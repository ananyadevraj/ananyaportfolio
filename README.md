<li>Evaluated and interpreted the data in order to come up with solutions for how airlines can improve their customer satisfaction and to better understand what makes a good airline.</li>
<li>Performed statistical analysis using correlation coefficients and by creating a function to calculate conditional probabilities and using Python's stats library. </li>
<li> Fit a logistic regression model to the data in order to predict whether a customer will be satisfied or dissatisfied using classification. </li>
