<h2> Projects </h2>
<h3> <a href = 'https://github.com/ananyadevraj/Project-1'>Project 1: In-depth Analysis and Evaluation with Airline Passenger Satisfaction </a></h3>
<li>Investigated what makes a good airline and which factors customers value the most in terms of their satisfaction with an inflight experience through a <em>report-style EDA.</em> </li>
<li>Used <em>Python's Pandas library</em> for cleaning and manipulating the dataset containing feedback from airline passengers found on Kaggle with 103904 entries.</li>
<li>Visualized the data in order to analyze it using <em>Seaborn and Matplotlib's</em> diverse range of visual tools</li>
<li>Evaluated and interpreted the data in order to come up with solutions for how airlines can improve their customer satisfaction and to better understand what makes a good airline.</li>
<li>Performed <em>statistical analysis and probability theory</em> using correlation coefficients and by creating a function to calculate conditional probabilities and using Python's stats library. </li>
<li> Fit a <em>logistic regression model</em> to the data in order to predict whether a customer will be satisfied or dissatisfied using classification. </li>
